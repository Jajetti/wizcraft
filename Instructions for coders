Setting Up GitHub

Visit the GitHub site and create an account.
E-mail me your account username.
While you wait for me to manually add you as a collaborator on the project, install the GitHub application on your Mac or PC.
Once I've E-mailed you back saying that you have access to the project on GitHub, you visit the project page.
On the right side of the page, you'll find a button to "Clone in Desktop". Click this.
The GitHub app will open.
Log in if it asks you to, and specify a convenient location on your computer for the mod's files (don't use the 
Eclipse project folder for this).
You now have the most current files from the GitHub project page on your computer (this is your local repository).
You should have created an Eclipse project for wizcraft already.
Copy the folder src/main from you local GitHub repository to the src/main folder in your Eclipse project.
Make edits to the files in Eclipse, add files, etc.
Copy those changed files over to your local repository.
Open the GitHub App.
Select the local repository on the left.
Review the changes you have made.
Enter a description of the commit you are making.
Press Commit and then Sync.
You can see you commit now on the GitHub website.
